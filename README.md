This program will collect the quotes from the beginning of each chapter of the series A Practical Guide to Evil:

The quotes will then be compiled in a single page.

For the backend, I used Python and FastAPI to handle the scraping and API requests. 
On the frontend, I've displayed the quotes using Next.js.
